Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to MySQL! Here, you'll find practice code and notes I created while learning MySQL DBMS.
## Installation
Download and Install MySQL Server, Workbench and Shell from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

## Practice Code 
You can access all the practice code from (here)[https://github.com/umairsiddique3171/mysql/tree/main/mysql%20wb%20practice].

## Notes 
* composite primary keys?
* giving alias?
* inner join -> join
* left outer join -> left join
* right outer join -> right join
* avoid using implicit join 
* avoid using right join as when you are using multiple left and right joins things get really complex
* natural join is not recommended to use as sometimes it produces unexpected results
* set SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
* Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram
* parent table -> table where foreign key of another table exists as primary key
* child table -> table where primary key of another talble exists as foreign key
* drop table table_name;
* drop -> deletes table
* truncate -> deletes table data
* when we have two kind of data or more in a table we use self join to extract relevant data
* union vs union all
* we can use subqueries with select, from and where but 90% of the time we use them with where.
* drop view view_name
